Study Title	"Long-term health risks in PCOS occur prematurely with serum markers of oxidative stress impacting HDL maturation through oxidation of methionine residues in apolipoprotein A1"
Study Description	"Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have metabolic disturbances that closely resemble the metabolic syndrome, suggesting an increased risk for type 2 diabetes and possibly for cardiovascular disease. With the aim of determining the underlying mechanism by which PCOS is associated with these long-term health risks, here we use NMR and MS-based metabolomics to compare the lipoprotein profile and the serum metabolome of young and non-obese PCOS patients with age- and weight-matched control women. We demonstrate that elevated levels of methionine sulfoxide in PCOS serum are strongly correlated with the degree of oxidation of methionine residues in apolipoprotein-A1. As a result, there is an impaired maturation of HDL reflected in a decline of large HDL particles in women with PCOS. Remarkably, these metabolic disturbances were partially restored after 18 months of treatment with a novel combination of insulin sensitizers plus an anti-androgen (pioglitazone, metformin and flutamide). We postulate that hyperandrogenism in PCOS is the root cause of the oxidative damage in lipoproteins. Dyslipidemic features and hyperinsulinemia precede any other metabolic complication associated with the increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, including impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Taken together, these metabolite changes might also constitute early biomarkers of metabolic syndrome."

Study Protocol Description	"Untargeted metabolomic analyses on serum samples of PCOS and control patients were performed using two analytical platforms: 1H-NMR and LC-ESI-QTOF; each serum sample was split into two aliquots and run in parallel using the two analytical platforms."	"The second aliquot was used for LC-MS analysis. 30 μL of serum sample was mixed with 120 μL of cold ACN/H2O (1:1) with 1% meta-phosphoric acid (MPA) and 0.1% formic acid (previously filtered). Samples were vortexed vigorously for 30 seconds and stored at 20C for 2 hours to enable protein precipitation. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged 15 minutes at 4C and 15000 rpm and the supernetant was transferred to a LC-MS vial. "	"Samples were injected in a UHPLC system (1290 Agilent) coupled to a quadrupole time of flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer (6550 Agilent Technologies) operated in positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) mode. Metabolites were separated using either C18-RP (ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 1.8 ?L, Waters) or HILIC (ACQUITY UPLC BEH 1.7 ?L, Waters) chromatography at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The solvent system in C18-RP was A= 0.1% formic in water, and B= 0.1% formic in acetonitrile. The linear gradient elution started at 100% A (time 0�3 min) and finished at 100% B (20�21 min). The solvent system in HILIC was A= 50mM NH4OcA in water, and B= ACN. The linear gradient elution started at 95% B (time 0�2 min) and finished at 55% B (6 min). "	"The injection volume was 2 μL. ESI conditions were gas temperature, 225C; drying gas, 13 L min-1; nebulizer, 20 psig; fragmentor, 125 V; and skimmer, 65 V. The instrument was set to acquire over the m/z range 80-1200 with an acquisition rate of 4 spectra/s. "	""	""	"For the NMR measurement 250 µL of serum were mixed with 250 µL of phosphate buffer (0.75 mM Na2HPO4 adjusted at pH 7.4, and 20% D2O to provide the field frequency lock). The final solution was transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube and kept refrigerated at 4C in the autosampler until the analysis. "	"1H-NMR spectra were recorded at 310 K on a Bruker Avance III 600 spectrometer operating at a proton frequency of 600.20 MHz using a 5 mm CPTCI triple resonance (1H, 13C, 31P). Three different 1H-NMR pulse experiments were performed for each sample: 1) Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY)-presaturation sequence to suppress the residual water peak; and 2) Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence (CPMG, spin-spin T2 relaxation filter) with a total time filter of 410 ms to attenuate the signals of serum macro-molecules to a residual level; 20 ppm spectral width and a total of 64 transients collected into 64 k data points."
