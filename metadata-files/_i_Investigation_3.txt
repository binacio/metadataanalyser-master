STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS102"
Study Title	"Comparative analysis of the adaptation of Staphylococcus aureus to internalization by different types of human non-professional phagocytic host cells"
Study Description	"We comparatively analyzed survival and physiological adaptation of S. aureus HG001 to two human lung epithelial cell lines (S9 and A549), and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293). Combining enrichment of bacteria from host-pathogen assays by cell sorting and quantitation of the pathogen's proteome by mass spectrometry we characterized S. aureus adaptation during the initial phase between 2.5 h and 6.5 h post-infection. Metabolome analysis was performed for the infection medium (extracellular medium, mock infection of 1 h)."

Study Protocol Description	"Two ml of cell culture supernatant were filtered through a 0.22 µm syringe sterile filter (Sarstedt AG&Co) and directly frozen."	"Each 400 µl sample volume were buffered to a pH of 7.0 by adding 200 µl of a 0.2 mol/l sodium hydrogen phosphate buffer solution, made up with 50% D2O (Euriso-Top, St-Aubin Cedex, France), which provides a NMR-lock signal. Additionally, the buffer solution contained 1 mmol/l TSP (3-trimethylsilyl-[2,2,3,3-D4]-1-propionic acid) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) as an internal standard for subsequent quantification."	"Qualitative and quantitative data analysis was carried out in a Bruker AVANCE-II 600 NMR spectrometer operated by TOPSPIN 3.1 software and by using AMIX®-Viewer v3.9.11 (Bruker Biospin)."	"All NMR spectra were obtained at 600.27 MHz at a temperature of 310 K using a Bruker AVANCE-II 600 NMR spectrometer, operated by TOPSPIN 2.1 software (both from Bruker Biospin GmbH, Rheinstetten, Germany). A 1D-NOESY pulse sequence was used with presaturation on the residual HDO signal during both the relaxation delay and the mixing time. A total of 64 free induction decays (FID scans) were collected, using a spectral width of 30 ppm for a one-dimensional spectrum."	""	"For data analysis the using AMIX®-Viewer v3.9.11 (Bruker Biospin), identification was based on spectra alignment of pure standard compounds (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA). For quantification designated peaks were integrated and compared to the TSP signal, considering the number of protons for each signal [1].
