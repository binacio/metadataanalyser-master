Study Title	"The Human Saliva Metabolome"
Study Description	"Saliva is composed of a variety of molecules that modulate the oral cavity. It is mainly composed of water (95%) and several minor components such as electrolytes, proteins, and low molecular weight compounds. It consists of metabolites from drinks, foods, drugs, environmental contaminants, and bacterial by-products. As part of the ongoing human metabolome project, the human cerebrospinal fluid metabolome, the human serum metabolome, and recently the human urine metabolome have been characterized. Unlike urine, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid, saliva metabolomics have not shown much progress. Therefore, the present study aims at characterizing the human saliva metabolome. In an attempt to understand saliva metabolomics, we have undertaken comprehensive multi analytical tools based quantitative metabolomics. Only nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data is presented"

Study Protocol Description	"Human saliva samples were collected from 16 healthy adult volunteers. Collection was done in the early morning before tooth brushing by a standard method (Sugimoto et al. 2010) consisted of spitting into a 50 mL sterile falcon tube. To assess the effect of sampling time on concentrations of salivary metabolites, samples were also collected three times (before breakfast, 2 hrs after breakfast and 2 hrs. after lunch) in a day.  Following collections, the samples were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min to remove particulate matter and the aliquots were stored in eppendorf tubes at -20 Â°C until analysis."	""	""	"All 1H-NMR spectra were collected on a 500 MHz Inova (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA) spectrometer using the first transient of the tnnoesy-presaturation pulse sequence."	""	"The resulting 1H-NMR spectra were processed and analyzed using the Chenomx NMR Suite Professional software package version 7.7 (Chenomx Inc., Edmonton, AB) as previously described (Bouatra et al. 2013; Psychogios et al. 2011). Each spectrum was processed and analyzed by two experienced NMR spectroscopists to minimize compound mis-identification and mis-quantification. "	""	"Saliva samples contain proteins and particulate matter, which affects the quality of proton NMR by interfering with the identification and quantification of metabolites. Deproteinization of the human saliva samples was done by centrifuging and ultra-filtering the samples following a previously reported procedure (Psychogios et al. 2011)"
